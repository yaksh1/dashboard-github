# Task 1: At-a-Glance Summary Bar

## Changes Made

- Modified `src/components/DashboardView.jsx` to add a new stat card for "Avg. PR Merge Time".
- Implemented the logic to calculate the average pull request merge time in `src/utils.js` and used it in `DashboardView.jsx`.
- Removed the "Avg. PR Age" stat card.

# Task 2: Insightful Graphs and Visualizations

## Changes Made

- Implemented the `ActivityChart.jsx` component to display the number of opened and closed issues and PRs over the last 90 days.
- The `LabelsChart.jsx` component was already implemented and meets the requirements.
- Implemented the "Staleness Highlighting" feature by adding CSS classes to `App.css` and the necessary logic to `ListView.jsx`.

## Next Steps

- All tasks are completed.
