### 1. The "At-a-Glance" Summary Bar

This section sits at the top and provides an immediate health check of the repository, allowing Deva to make a quick initial judgment.

- **Visual**: A series of "Stat Cards" with large, clear numbers and descriptive labels.
- **Content**:
  - **Open Issues**: Total count of open issues.
  - **Open PRs**: Total count of open pull requests.
  - **Avg. Issue Age**: Average time an issue has been open. A high number might indicate a lack of maintenance.
  - **Avg. PR Merge Time**: Average time from PR creation to merge. This signals how quickly contributions are handled.
- **Interaction**: Hovering over a stat card could reveal a small tooltip with more context, like "30 issues were closed in the last month."
- **UX Principle**: **Visual Hierarchy**. This presents the most critical information first, allowing for rapid assessment before diving into details.

### 2. Insightful Graphs and Visualizations

This area replaces a simple wall of text with charts that tell a story about the repository's activity and focus.

- **Graph 1: Activity Trend**

  - **Visual**: A simple line or bar chart showing activity over the last 30 or 90 days.
  - **Content**: Two lines: one for `Items Opened` (issues + PRs) and one for `Items Closed`.
  - **Why it helps**: Deva can instantly see if the project is active, stagnating, or in a "cleanup" phase. It answers the question: "Is this project alive?"

- **Graph 2: Issue/PR Breakdown by Labels**

  - **Visual**: A horizontal bar chart (which is easier to read than a pie chart for multiple categories).
  - **Content**: Shows the number of open items grouped by common, actionable labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, and especially **`good first issue`** or **`help wanted`**.
  - **Interaction**: **This is key**: Clicking on a bar (e.g., the "good first issue" bar) should instantly filter the detailed list below to show only those items. This connects insight directly to action.

- **Visual 3: Staleness Highlighting**
  - **Visual**: This isn't a separate graph but a visual treatment applied directly to the lists of issues and PRs.
  - **Content**: Use a subtle color-coding system. For example:
    - A pale red highlight for items with no activity in over 30 days.
    - A small green dot for items active in the last 24 hours.
  - **UX Principle**: **The Von Restorff Effect**. The distinct color makes these items stand out, helping Deva triage what's urgent or what's been neglected without having to read every date.

### 3. Rich and Seamless Interactions

Interactions are what make a dashboard feel like a powerful tool rather than a static report. The guiding principle here is **"Don't Make Me Think."**

- **Interaction 1: The "Live" Filter Panel**

  - **Visual**: An always-visible panel to the side of the lists. Hiding filters behind a click adds friction.
  - **Content**:
    - A single text search bar for keywords.
    - Checkboxes or toggles for common `Labels`.
    - A dropdown to sort by `Newest`, `Most Comments`, `Recently Updated`, etc.
  - **Why it helps**: This gives Deva precise control to narrow down the noise. As she clicks filters, the list below should update instantly without a page reload, providing immediate feedback.

- **Interaction 2: The "No-Context-Switch" Detail View**

  - **Visual**: When Deva clicks on an issue or PR title, instead of navigating to a new page, a **modal window** or an **inline expandable section (accordion)** opens up.
  - **Content**: This view shows the item's full description, metadata (author, labels), and a prominent **"View on GitHub"** button for when she's ready to take the final step.
  - **UX Principle**: **Maintaining Context**. This is the single most important interaction for Deva's workflow. It allows her to rapidly scan and evaluate multiple items without ever losing her place in the filtered list.

- **Interaction 3: Shareable Views**
  - **Visual**: A "Share" or "Copy Link" button near the top of the dashboard.
  - **Content**: When clicked, it generates a unique URL that saves the current state of all applied filters and sorting options.
  - **Why it helps**: This addresses the final stage of her journey. She can bookmark her findings for later or share a specific view with a colleague, turning a personal research tool into a collaborative one.
