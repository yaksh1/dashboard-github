User Journey Map: GitHub Repo Dashboard

Persona: Deva, The Efficient DeveloperScenario: Deva wants to find a good first issue to work on in a popular open-source library.Goal: Quickly identify active, relevant, and beginner-friendly issues and pull requests.

Phase 1: Discovery & Entry

Actions:

Deva hears about the dashboard tool from a developer blog.

She navigates to the tool's homepage.

User's Thoughts & Feelings:

"This sounds like exactly what I need. I hope it's easy to use." ü§î

"The homepage is clean. Just one input box. I like that."

Pain Points:

A cluttered landing page would be an instant turn-off.

If the value proposition isn't immediately clear, she might leave.

Design Opportunities:

Minimalist UI: A single, prominent input field for the repository link.

Clear Headline: A headline like, "Get a bird's-eye view of any GitHub repository," to instantly convey the purpose.

Phase 2: Input & Initiation

Actions:

She copies the URL of the target GitHub repository.

She pastes the link into the input field.

She clicks the "Analyze Repository" button.

User's Thoughts & Feelings:

"Okay, let's see what it can do."

"I hope it loads quickly. Is it working?" ‚è≥

Pain Points:

The tool failing to parse a valid GitHub URL.

No visual feedback after clicking the button, leading to uncertainty.

Design Opportunities:

Smart Input: Automatically validate the URL and accept multiple formats (.git, http://, https://).

Provide Feedback: Show a loading animation or progress bar to manage expectations and confirm the system is working. This adheres to the principle of keeping the user informed.

Phase 3: Information Consumption

Actions:

The dashboard loads, presenting an overview.

She scans the page, looking at key metrics and lists.

User's Thoughts & Feelings:

"Wow, this is organized! I can see open PRs and issues right away." ü§©

"Okay, a summary at the top is useful. I can quickly see the number of open vs. closed issues."

"Where are the beginner-friendly issues?"

Pain Points:

A simple, long list of all PRs/issues would be overwhelming and no better than GitHub's own interface. This violates the "Don't Make Me Think" principle.

Lack of visual hierarchy, making it hard to distinguish important information.

Design Opportunities:

Information Architecture: Structure the page with clear, distinct sections for "Pull Requests" and "Issues."

Visual Hierarchy: Use size, color, and weight to draw attention. For example, issue titles should be prominent, while metadata can be less emphasized.

Smart Defaults: By default, show only open items.

At-a-glance Summary: Include a top-level summary card with key stats (e.g., number of open PRs, open issues, items labeled 'help wanted').

Phase 4: Interaction & Deeper Dive

Actions:

She uses a filter to show only issues with the "good first issue" label.

The list updates instantly.

She clicks on an interesting issue to learn more.

User's Thoughts & Feelings:

"The filtering is fast and intuitive. This is great!" ‚úÖ

"I can see the issue details without leaving the page. Perfect."

"I've found one! Now I can go to GitHub to start working on it."

Pain Points:

Clicking on an item and being navigated away from the dashboard, breaking her flow.

Slow or clunky filtering controls.

Design Opportunities:

Seamless Interaction: Use modals or an accordion pattern to display issue/PR details. This keeps the user in context.

Easy Filtering: Provide intuitive filter and sort options (e.g., by label, author, number of comments).

Clear Calls to Action: Within the detail view, provide a clear, external link button: "View on GitHub."

Phase 5: Goal Accomplishment & Exit

Actions:

Deva opens two promising issues in new tabs on GitHub.

She bookmarks the dashboard tool for future use.

User's Thoughts & Feelings:

"This tool is a lifesaver. It saved me so much time."

"I'm definitely sharing this with my team." üöÄ

Pain Points:

No way to save or share her current filtered view for later.

Design Opportunities:

Encourage Return Visits: Allow users to bookmark or "watch" specific repositories directly within the dashboard.

Enable Collaboration: Add a "Share View" button that generates a unique URL with the current filters applied.
